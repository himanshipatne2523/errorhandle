# Project Title

Error Handling with require revert and assert

## Description

The "ErrorHandling" Solidity contract showcases effective error management using require, revert, and assert statements. It ensures exclusive owner control with the setOwner function and handles insufficient balance scenarios through a custom error, "InsuffBal," triggered by the error function. The assert statement in addValue maintains a specified range for the 'total' value after additions. This contract emphasizes secure practices in ownership control and error handling. Thorough testing on a testnet is recommended before deployment for validation.
